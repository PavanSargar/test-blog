title: EVERYTHING SPORTS- Mr. Siddharth Deshmukh - just another post
quote: "I understood one thing very quickly: I have to be relevant for the
  sports industry for them to accept me. If you're not an athlete, their are
  only two ways you can be relevant - either bring money or save money."

**“Champions keep playing until they get it right.. and hence more I play... more I learn!”**

Mr. Siddharth Deshmukh is a seasoned business leader with nearly two decades of progressive experience in leveraging solution consulting & program management to Fortune 1000 clients, in the FMCG, Hi-Tech, Sports & Media vertical. He has worked on the "CxO-as-a-Service" model in Sportertainment, Technology & Management Consulting areas towards Brand Marketing, Business Strategy and CSR.

**“There are only two ways you can be relevant, if you're not an athlete the only two ways you can be relevant are either bring money or save money.”**

We were fortunate enough to have him discuss with us the growing commercialization in the sporting ecosystem and its sustainability up until the Olympic Games. Government did a great job, with the top team and spending money right like Odisha. They have built off the culture right and are clearly the capital of Indian Sports. Imagine 29 states, 7 union territories, every state and entity having one sport. Following Odisha, just how many other states are adopting different sports and helping them grow from the grassroots, where the main work should be done. Competition level can create an amateur and amateur can actually convert to elite. That's the pyramid I want to build and that's why I want to be remembered for somebody who did that.

**“I think then the Olympics should be ours, Asian Games should be ours, the Commonwealth Games should be ours.”**
