***"India is a beautiful chaos that we all know, in that situation; education is really helping me to structure my thoughts very well."***



***“Have a dream which either sounds funny to others or brings a tear to your eye.”*** Mr. Rosham Shetty is an international sports commentator & presenter, founder and director of a sports management startup “Sportytude”. His current experience in the sports industry encompasses several domains of sports including event management, sports commentary, presenting, grassroot development and coaching. We were fortunate to discuss the importance of a structured education system and impact of Physical Literacy in the life of sports enthusiasts looking for a career in sports. ***“The most important thing today is Data. When I speak about data, it includes all your facts, anecdotes, stats and everything.”***

A commenting philosophy which Mr. Shetty follows is to give his viewers something that they do not know. While discussing on athletes and Physical Literacy, Mr. Shetty mentioned that, Physical Literacy forms the base of every athlete or every individual that he interviews, so, whenever they speak with an athlete, a footballer, he would never speak directly about his physical literacy but I would mostly speak on the upper end of the pyramid to take him on. Physical Literacy as a much needed topic should become the center of an average conversation that you have as part of an interview or a presentation or commentary.

***“We somehow subtly put it forward across to them and eventually when they talk about it, it’s on us how we pick up on all the conversations that we have with them.”***
